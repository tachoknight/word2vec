# My Copy
This is my fork of this original repo so I could play around with it. I fixed a couple of numpy issues and it seems to work fine. Probably still want to use something more modern, but for playing around this is a good place.

# NOT MAINTAINED

- I have not used this code in a long time
- No issues or PRs can be created
- Latest release doesn't work with newer versions of numpy
- I recommened moving to a native alternative in Tensorflow or PyTorch

Python interface to Google word2vec.

Training is done using the original C code, other functionality is pure Python with numpy.

## Installation

```
pip install word2vec
```

### Compilation

The installation requires to compile the original C code using `gcc`.

You can override the compilation flags if needed:

```
WORD2VEC_CFLAGS='-march=corei7' pip install word2vec
```

**Windows:** There is basic some support for this support based on this [win32 port](https://github.com/zhangyafeikimi/word2vec-win32).

## Usage

Example notebook: [word2vec](https://nbviewer.org/github/danielfrg/word2vec/blob/main/examples/word2vec.ipynb)

The default functionality from word2vec is available with the following commands:
- `word2vec`
- `word2phrase`
- `word2vec-distance`
- `word2vec-word-analogy`
- `word2vec-compute-accuracy`

Experimental functionality on doc2vec can be found in this example:
